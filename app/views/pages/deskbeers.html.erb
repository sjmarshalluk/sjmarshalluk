      <h3>Founder, product, design &amp; growth</h3>

      <h2>I founded and ran DeskBeers whilst working at Mint Digital. We were generating revenue within eight weeks of concept, followed lean methodologies throughout, and the business is still thriving three years on.</h2>

      <p>During Mint Digital's transition from a digital agency to a startup studio, I was asked to explore some potential business opportunities. After holding several brainstorming sessions, the concept of DeskBeers was born. I built a small team to validate the idea, and then go on to create an MVP with which we were creating revenue within eight weeks. Over the following year, I grew the team and business to be sending over 1500 bottles of beer every week to all over the UK.</p>

      <p>At the beginning, everything was manual. Orders, payments, deliveries etc we're all completed by ourselves. We used a monsterous Google Sheet to track orders, GoCardless Paylinks to request and recieve payments, and ZipCar to delivery the beer each Friday.</p>
