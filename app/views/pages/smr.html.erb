      <p>I have worked with SMR on and off for over two years. During this time, I have helped them with the branding, design, marketing and strategy of their last three bi-annual events. Due to the nature of the event as well as budget restrictions, the work is often fast paced and packed in the few weeks prior to each event. </p>
      <p>Being a twice-a-year event, the ability to test and adapt is limited, but with each event, we try to concentrate on one or two aspects to improve. For example, for SMR12, I completely rewrote and rebuilt the entire MailChimp campaign.</p>
      <p>Silicon Milkroundabout is Europe's leading tech job fair. Having held eleven bi-annual events in London, they attract upto 200 companies and thousands of candidates. I have worked with them on their past three events to deliver the event branding, design production, product development and streamlining processes.</p>

    <div class="c4 med-c6 sml-c12">
      <p>For each of the last three events, I have been solely responsible for the management and production of all assets surrounding the event. This ranges from marketing emails &amp; digital tickets to the &#126;150 booklet, lanyards and wayfinding.</p>
      <p>Due to the nature of the event and the budget allowed, this whole process from event branding to final print production is approximately 2-3 weeks of work. During this time for SMR11, I also re-built and re-wrote all marketing emails.</p>
